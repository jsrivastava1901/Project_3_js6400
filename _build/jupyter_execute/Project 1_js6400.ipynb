    "\n",
    "The dataset was downloaded from the ACLED database. It contains instances of political disorders (violent and non-violent) directly or indirectly involving actors in peacekeeping missions from 1997 - 2024. This dataset covers a variety of peacekeeping missions like MINUSMA, AMISOM etc. *More details are available here: https://acleddata.com/knowledge-base/faqs-what-can-and-cannot-be-done-with-acled-data-on-disorder-involving-peacekeepers/*\n",
    "\n",
    "### Overall Approach:\n",
    "\n",
    "I found that it was easier to write codes when I was using pandas, as compared to working on the codes the 'hard way.' Nonetheless, it was an interesting exercise especially in terms of interpretation and visualization of data. I took the help of a friend (who studied computer science) who checked my codes and I made some modifications accordingly. "
